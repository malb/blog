#+DESCRIPTION:

[[http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.groth/IMACC.html][IMA-CCC]] ([[https://www.facebook.com/events/820767331310476/][Facebook]]) is a crypto and coding conference biennially held in the UK. It was previously
held in Cirencester. So you might have heard of it as the “Cirncester” conference. However, it has
been moved to Oxford, so calling it Cirencester now is a bit confusing. Anyway, it is happening
again this year. IMA is a small but fine conference with the added perk of being right before
Christmas. This is great because around that time of the year Oxford is a fairly Christmas-y place
to be.

** Call for Papers

The mathematical theory and practice of cryptography and coding underpins the provision of effective
security and reliability for data communication, processing and storage. Theoretical and practical
advances in the fields of cryptography and coding are therefore a key factor in facilitating the
growth of data communications and data networks of various types. Thus, this fifteenth International
Conference in an established and successful IMA series on the theme of "Cryptography and Coding" is
both timely and relevant. Original research papers on all technical aspects of cryptography and
coding are solicited for submission. The proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series, and will be available at the conference.

*** Instructions for Authors

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or
has submitted in parallel to a journal or any other conference or workshop with proceedings.
Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings.
Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference and
must make a full version of their paper available online.

All submissions will be blind-reviewed. Papers must be anonymous, with no author names,
affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Submissions should begin with a cover page
containing title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. The body of the paper should be at most
14 pages, excluding the title page with abstract, the bibliography, and clearly marked appendices.
Committee members are not required to review appendices, so the paper should be intelligible and
self-contained within this length. The text should be in a single column format, in at least
11-point fonts and have reasonable margins. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection
without consideration of their merits.
