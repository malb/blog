#+DESCRIPTION:
New versions of fplll and fpylll were released today. I’ve reproduced release notes below for greater visibility. The biggest user-visible changes for fplll are probably that 

- CVP enumeration is not experimental any more,
- support for external enumeration libraries (go write that GPU implementation of enumeration) was added and
- support for OSX was greatly improved.

On the fpylll side, the biggest user-visible changes are probably various API updates and a much nicer strategy/framework for gathering statistics about BKZ.

The next version of fplll will contain support for [[https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/236][LLL reduction on Gram matrices]].

** Release Notes

*** Fplll

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hi there,

fplll 5.1.0 was released on 26 March 2017 and is available at

https://github.com/fplll/fplll/releases/tag/5.1.0

Major changes in fplll-5.1.0 compared to fplll-5.0.3:

- CVP is not experimental any longer by implementing the resetting feature (Guillaume Bonnoron https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/191)

- pruner rewrite providing faster pruning, a new greedy pruning strategy, support for multiple solutions and a simpler API (Léo Ducas https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/228)

- support for external enumeration libraries paving the way for multithreaded/MPI/GPU enumeration libraries. See https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/fplll-extenum for an example external library (Marc Stevens https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/227)

- Gaussian Heuristic improved and renamed to ‘adjust\_radius\_to\_gh\_bound‘ (Léo Ducas https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/231)

- Reduced calls to LLL during BKZ (Martin Albrecht https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/226, Damien Stehlé and Shi Bai https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/230)

- Greatly improved OSX support (Martin Albrecht and Isuru Fernando https://github.com/fplll/fplll/issues/205,)

- Evaluator rewrite/refactoring now supporting different evaluation strategies (Marc Stevens https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/224)

- We now enforce coding conventions (Tancrède Lepoint https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/215, https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/219)

We also fixed various other issues, see https://github.com/fplll/fplll/compare/5.0.3...5.1.0 for details.

The following people have contributed to this release (based on the link above):

- Martin Albrecht 
- Shi Bai
