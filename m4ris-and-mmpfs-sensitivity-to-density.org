The last couple of days I've been working on improving libM4RI for sparse-ish matrices. The matrices I am talking about here are still represented as dense matrices but have non-uniformly distributed entries. While PLUQ factorisation is still very very (very very) slow for e.g. half rank matrices, things are getting better for M4RI matrix elimination.

The [[http://www.bitbucket.org/malb/m4ri/src/221/src/brilliantrussian.c][updated]] sources are available on bitbucket. I will probably cut a new release very early next year.
