It seems all the information on printing from proper operating systems at the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London available online is a bit outdated. So here's what you should do when using CUPS:

1. The URL for printing is =lpd://USERNAME@rhulprint.rhul.ac.uk/MA-Follow-Me= where =USERNAME= is your college username (it's a random looking combination of letters and numbers). The trick I was missing for a long time was that you need to add your username. Thanks, [[http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/jacob-schuldt(54a3a5e3-edb2-41d4-b5aa-96517240f8d1).html][Jacob]].

2. Download the right PPD for *KONICA MINOLTA bizhub C452* from the [[http://www.konicaminolta.eu/en/business-solutions/support/download-center.html][Konica website]].
3. Now print to MA-Follow-Me, go to, say, the postroom, swipe your card and retrieve your sweet, sweet print outs.
