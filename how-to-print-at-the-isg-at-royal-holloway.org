#+TITLE: How to print at the ISG at Royal Holloway

It seems all the information on printing from proper operating systems at the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London available online is a bit outdated. So here's what you should do when using CUPS:

1. The URL for printing is *lpd://USERNAME@isg-uniprint.isg.rhul.ac.uk/MA-Follow-Me* where USERNAME is your college username (it's a random looking combination of letters and numbers). The trick I was missing for a long time was that you need to add your username. Thanks, [[http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/jacob-schuldt(54a3a5e3-edb2-41d4-b5aa-96517240f8d1).html][Jacob]].
2. Download the right PPD for *KONICA MINOLTA bizhub C452* from the [[http://www.konicaminolta.eu/en/business-solutions/support/download-center.html][Konica website]].
3. Now print to MA-Follow-Me, go to, say, the postroom, swipe your card and retrieve your sweet, sweet print outs.
