I just uploaded new releases of[[http://m4ri.sagemath.org/downloads/m4ri-20100730.tar.gz][M4RI]] and [[http://m4ri.sagemath.org/downloads/m4rie-20100730.tar.gz][M4RIE]] to the[[http://m4ri.sagemath.org][M4RI]] website. Not much changed except that I implemented Strassen multiplication in M4RIE. The results are visualised below, where blue means M4RIE wins and red means Magma wins. The first two plots are for a Xeon (eno at UW) and the last two for an Opteron (prai243 at RHUL).

I've also updated the Sage package [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9562]] such that it is easier to play around with the new code.
