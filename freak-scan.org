#+DESCRIPTION:
It is Friday and all teaching is done for the week. Also, it has been about 10 days since the [[https://freakattack.com/][FREAK attack]] was made public. Hence, /the/ most natural idea is to scan the Internet for hosts that are still vulnerable and [[https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf][mining their Ps and Qs]]. After all, the [[https://zmap.io][tools]] for the [[https://factorable.net/resources.html][job]] are readily available. Hereâ€™s [[https://martinralbrecht.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/freak-scan1.pdf][what we found]].
