The various matrix decompositions (LSP, PLUQ, LQUP, PLE, CUP ...) and their relation to Gaussian elimination can be a bit confusing. [[http://membres-liglab.imag.fr/pernet/][Clément]] recently gave a nice talk about these, their relation, their complexities, parallelisation and our implementation of PLE decomposition in the M4RI library. I didn't attend the talk but the [[http://membres-liglab.imag.fr/pernet/Publications/ECCAD11_pernet.pdf][slides]] surely are interesting.
