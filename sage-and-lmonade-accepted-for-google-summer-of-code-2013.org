Both the [[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/sage][Sage]] and the [[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/lmonade][lmonade]] project were successful in applying to Google Summer of Code 2013. If you are a student head over to their respective GSOC pages and get in touch. If you want to do a project related the stuff I write about on this blog, i.e., with me as a mentor, get in touch as well.
