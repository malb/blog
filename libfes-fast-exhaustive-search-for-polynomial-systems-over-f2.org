[[http://www.lifl.fr/~bouillag/][Charles Bouillaguet]] set up a nice shiny [[http://www.lifl.fr/~bouillag/fes/][website]] for libFES the library for exhaustive search on polynomial systems over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The library has a Sage interface, so it's easy to get started. It's also integrated in Charles' upcoming one-stop boolean system solving [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13850][patch]].

He calls his benchmarketing "bragging rights" ... and boy has he earned those rights! Check it out, libFES is fast!
