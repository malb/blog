#+TITLE: Sage, Degrees and Gröbner Bases

For one reason on [[http://martinralbrecht.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/breaking-an-identity-based-encryption-scheme-based-on-dhies/][another]] I found myself computing Gröbner bases over fields which are not $\mathbb{F}_2$.  Thus, my interest in Sage's interface to [[http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/][Singular]] and [[http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/][Magma]] increased quite a bit again recently (before I was mainly using [[http://polybori.sourceforge.net/][PolyBoRi]]). Hence I wrote two patches which need review (hint, hint):

*[[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10331][#10331]]*

A natural question when it comes to Gröbner basis computations is of course how much resources a particular input system is going to require. For many systems (in fact it is conjectured that it holds for /most/ systems) it turns out one can estimate the degree which will be reached during the computation by computing the degree of semi-regularity of the homogenisation of the system, i.e. one computes the first non-zero coefficient of the following power series:

$\sum_{k\geq 0} c_k z\^k = \frac{\prod_{i=0}\^{m-1} (1-z\^{d_i})}{(1-z)\^n}$

where $d_i$ are the respective degrees of the input polynomials. While there is a Magma script readily available for computing the degree of semi-regularity (by [[http://www-salsa.lip6.fr/~bettale/][Luk Bettale]]) we didn't have it for Sage.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

sage: sr = mq.SR(1,2,1,4)
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()
sage: I = F.ideal()
sage: I.degree_of_semi_regularity()
3

#+END_SRC

Thus, we expect to only reach degree three to compute a Gröbner basis  for $I$:

It's nice to see how far a particular computation is progressed and to get some summary information about the  computation in the end. Hence, a new patch which enables live logs from Singular and Magma in Sage.
