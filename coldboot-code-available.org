After receiving two inquiries about the coldboot attack paper which were best answered by looking at the code or by comparing with our code, I figured it was about time I put it online. So here it is:

[[//bitbucket.org/malb/algebraic_attacks/src/1af75effcc7d/coldboot][https://bitbucket.org/malb/algebraic_attacks/src/1af75effcc7d/coldboot]]

For this code to run you'll need to apply this patch to[[http://www.sagemath.org][Sage]]:

[[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10879]]

which adds an interface to [[http://scip.zib.de/][SCIP]]. Unfortunately, this patch crashes on OSX and I didn't figure out yet why. Anybody willing to help, please step forward :)

Also, I assume the code on bitbucket needs some patching to work with the most recent version of Sage. Patches very welcome!
