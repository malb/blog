For some strange reason it hardly every occurs to me to benchmark GAP when it comes to linear algebra over GF(2\^e). Turns out, that's a really bad idea as it seems to be the best open-source implementation for such things. For example, computing the reduced row echelon form of a 4,000 x 4,000 random matrix over $\mathbb{F}_{16}$ takes 16.94s in GAP 4.4.12 but 3267s in Sage and 1005s in NTL 5.4.2. So much much faster than other established open-source projects out there.

I hope [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6391][libgap]] becomes a reality at some point in the future.

PS: For comparison, Magma does the same task in in 4.67s and [[http://m4ri.sagemath.org][M4RIE]] in 0.71s.
