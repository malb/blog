At Royal Holloway we are now taking applications for *ten* fully-funded PhD positions in Information Security. See the [[https://royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday/][CDT website]] and the [[https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/][ISG website]] for what kind of research we do. In particular, check out our [[https://royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday/][past and current CDT students]] to get an idea of how broad and diverse the areas of information security are in which they work. 

Note that most of these positions are reserved for UK residents, which does, however, not mean nationality (see CDT website for details) and there might also be some wiggle room for EU residents.

Royal Holloway is pleased to announce up to 10 fully-funded PhD studentships (four years of enhanced stipend and fees) in its EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security for the Everyday.

The CDT was first established in 2013, and has as its main objective to develop cohorts of multidisciplinary researchers with a broad understanding of cyber security and a strong appreciation of the interplay between technical and social issues.

Research in the CDT will address challenges concerning:

- the technologies deployed in digital systems that people use, sometimes inadvertently, every day;
- the everyday societal experience and practice of security.

The CDT is centred around Royal Hollowayâ€™s Information Security Group and partners with departments throughout the institution. We offer a collegiate and inclusive environment, exemplified by our award-winning WISDOM group, which supports female cyber-security staff and students.

CDT researchers follow a four-year PhD programme. The first year consists of comprehensive multidisciplinary cyber security training. The remaining three years focus on research in an advanced topic in the field of cyber security, including, but are not restricted to:

- Embedded technology security
- Secure and trusted systems
- Cryptography and its applications
- Trust, rights and understanding of cyber security
- Methodological innovation in researching cyber security
- Difference and inequalities in cyber security

We welcome applications from candidates with undergraduate and/or masters qualifications in a wide range of technical and social disciplines of relevance to cyber security.
