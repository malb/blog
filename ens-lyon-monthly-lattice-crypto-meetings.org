Dear all,

We are setting up a "soft-monthly" meeting on lattices and cryptography, at ENS Lyon. The meetings
will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format that will hopefully encourage
interactions (blackboard, long time slots).

The first meeting, on September 30th and October 1st, will be on Lattice-based and code-based group signatures.

/Tentative program/

We 30/09, 2:30pm - 3:30pm: Benoît Libert

*Tutorial on group signatures*

We 30/09, 4:00pm - 5:30pm:  Khoa Nguyen

*Group signatures from lattices: simpler, tighter, shorter, ring-based*

Th 01/10, 10:15am - 11:15am: Khoa Nguyen

*A provably secure group signature scheme from code-based assumptions*

Th 1:30pm -3:00pm: Philippe Gaborit

*Dynamic traceable signature on lattices with non-frameability property*

Th 3:30pm - 5pm: Fabrice Mouhartem

*Lattice-based group signatures for dynamic groups*

/Location/

ENS de Lyon, Monod campus, main building, level 1, room 116.

/Registration/

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. speakers are told the audience  is somewhat familiar with lattices and crypto
2. please send me (damien.stehle_AT_ens-lyon.fr) an email, so that the size of the room fits with the number of participants.

/Housing/
