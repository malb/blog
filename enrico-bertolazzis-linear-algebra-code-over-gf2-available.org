[[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bertolaz/][Enrico]] made the [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233927317_GF2toolkit_software_used_in_the_manuscript_Fast_matrix_decomposition_in_F2?ev=prf_pub][code]] (if the link doesn't work search for his name on Research Gate) for his LU factorisation code over GF(2) available online under the GPL. This is an implement of the algorithm described by Anna and him in [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5198][Fast matrix decomposition in F2]] and for which they give timings in that paper (discussed a bit [[http://martinralbrecht.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/m4ri-20121224/][here]]). I had to fix some includes to make it compile on my box, but nothing major. I can also confirm the impressive performance of their software (I ran =testRankComputation=).

*PS:* I managed to catch up in terms of performance up to dimension 4096 x 4096 with M4RI. However, 8192 x 8192 is still slower - at least on my machine - than Enrico's code. I would suspect that this is down to us not using the cache as effectively as Enrico, possibly because of the different matrix representation (row major) .
